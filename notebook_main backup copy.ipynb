    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook describes the process of creating a model to predict parcel volumes for the output belts of parcel sorting centers in Finland. The goal is to plan for a two-week period based on historic data. Models were constructed using varying methods to decide which is the most useful, looking for a balance in accuracy, simplicity, running time and generalizability. The research question aimed to be answered is how can time-series forecasting methods be used to predict future parcel volume in sorting centers? Two sub-questions  are explored to obtain an answer to the research question:\n",

    "   - a.) What does the raw data look like (variables, structure, etc.)?\n",
    "   - b.) What correlations or relationships exist between variables in the data (e.g., between time of day, distribution center, and package volume)?\n",
    "   - c.) How should the data be prepared and cleaned (e.g., handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies)?\n",
    "   - d.) What are the daily frequencies of package deliveries, and are there seasonal patterns (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly trends)?\n",
    "   - e.) How do the distribution centers differ from each other in terms of package volume and other key metrics \\[‘VANTAA’, ‘KUOPIO’, ‘OULU’, ‘SEINÄJOKI’, ‘TAMPERE’\\]?\n",
    "   - f.) How many outliers are present, and how do we identify them (e.g., through statistical or machine learning methods)?\n",
    "   - g.) What is the statistical distribution of the data points (e.g., normal, skewed, or multimodal)?\n",
    "   - h.) How do holidays and special events impact the volume of packages?\n",

December's average demand is lower than most months, likely due to the reduced activity between Christmas and New Year, which is also evident in the planning horizon plot. Notably, demand in November and December fluctuates significantly, as shown by the peaks in the violin plots, while March and August show a relatively narrow range.\n",

Incorporating such patterns could maybe enhance the accuracy of demand forecasting."

To check which variables were most useful, different combinations of features were used in a model to predict aggregate demand for sorting center Vantaa, and those yielding the best results were used in this model. The chosen features are 7 lag variables that represent the values of the last 7 days, the day of the week, and a sine and cosine of this day of the week (with period 7). Increasing the number of lag features did not improve the results.\n",

    "### Code Explanation: `SimpleNN` Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SimpleNN` class defines a neural network with multiple fully connected layers and a custom activation function (`swish`). Here’s a breakdown of its structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Network Architecture**:\n",
    "   - `fc1` to `fc6`: Six fully connected layers with varying output dimensions.\n",
    "   - Skip connections are implemented in the `forward` method for `fc2` and `fc4`, allowing information from earlier layers to be added directly to later ones, which helps retain important features and reduces the risk of gradient vanishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Swish Activation Function**:\n",
    "   - `swish`: A custom activation function, defined as `x * sigmoid(x)`, is used to introduce non-linearity. Swish often outperforms ReLU by allowing small negative values, which can improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forward Pass**:\n",
    "   - The input passes through each layer with the Swish activation applied.\n",
    "   - After `fc1`, `fc2` and `fc4` layers use skip connections, enhancing learning by preserving important features.\n",
    "   - Finally, `fc6` outputs a single value (presumably for regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this structure with Swish activation and skip connections is designed to improve learning efficiency and capture complex patterns in the data.\n"

This results in long computation times for making predictions —about two minutes for GRU and LSTM models, even with plotting functions disabled. Applying this approach to each output belt is not feasible. Later, we will try to use a similar method but we will be employing parralel computing to decrease the computation times."

    "We were inspired by the success of CEEMDAN (Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise) in improving clustering models. However, while CEEMDAN is well-suited for aggregated time-series analysis, it lacks the granularity required for predicting outputs at the level of each output belt within each sorting center. Therefore, we adapted its core decomposition philosophy to suit our specific needs, allowing us to improve the computational efficiency by enabling parallel processing across belts. This adaptation not only drew upon the strength of CEEMDAN in decomposing non-stationary signals but also introduced modifications that better accommodate the unique characteristics of our problem—specifically the need to process data for multiple output belts concurrently. Our approach ensures each output belt can be analyzed individually while maintaining computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the challenge of predicting sparse time-series data in this project, we designed a predictive approach combining GRU and signal decomposition techniques. The objective of the project is to predict event counts for different conveyor belts at each sorting center. Due to data sparsity and the presence of outliers, traditional time-series methods struggle to effectively model the behavior. In this context, we chose the GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model as it effectively captures both short- and long-term dependencies with fewer parameters, making it more suitable for training on sparse data compared to more complex LSTM models, which may be prone to overfitting in this scenario. To enhance the model's generalization ability and extract latent patterns from the data, we applied signal decomposition techniques—using both wavelet transform and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). This was done to provide clearer learning inputs for the GRU, enhancing its ability to handle the peculiarities of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the signal processing step, the wavelet transform was utilized to decompose each conveyor belt's signal into different frequency components, thereby extracting richer information in both time and frequency domains. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was used to decompose the signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), making it particularly effective at capturing nonlinear and non-stationary signal characteristics. By employing this hybrid signal decomposition strategy, the model can avoid being misled by outliers within the sparse data, extracting the most useful features for predicting event counts. We also employed data augmentation techniques by adding random shifts and introducing synthetic outliers to increase data volume, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the model. In the final setup, each sorting center's conveyor belts were modeled individually, ensuring the accuracy of the prediction to align with the unique dynamic patterns of each belt.\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively train these models, we employed a strategy combining GRU with specific optimization techniques. The optimization process leveraged Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum, which helps accelerate convergence and reduce the influence of outliers during training. Learning rates were dynamically adjusted using a cosine annealing scheduler to ensure that the model finds a global optimum effectively during the latter part of training. For each sorting center's conveyor belts, we independently calculated the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Variance of Squared Error (VSE) to assess the model's overall performance and its consistency across different time periods. With this comprehensive approach, we successfully developed custom predictive models for each sorting center, effectively addressing the challenges posed by the sparse data and achieving accurate event count predictions for each output belt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, there remain some challenges due to the inherent sparsity of the data and limitations in sampling duration. The average data volume per conveyor belt within each sorting center is relatively low, which makes it difficult for the model to capture complex dynamic features. Furthermore, the current dataset only spans one year, making it challenging to effectively capture seasonality and other cyclical patterns. Thus, while this model utilizes a variety of signal processing and optimization techniques, its predictive performance may be somewhat limited by the available data. This suggests that future improvements—such as expanding data volume and gathering multi-year data—could significantly enhance model performance."
