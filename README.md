# CIEM6302 Advanced Data Science for Traffic and Transportation Engineering PrimeVision Group 1

Meetings:
1. Every Tuesday 13:45-15:30 - Update meeting
2. Every Friday - Optional meeting

Main Question: \
How can time-series forecasting methods be used to predict future parcel volume in warehouses?

Subquestions:
1. Which time-series forecasting methods can accurately predict the parcel volume?
2. Which features significantly contribute to the prediction accuracy?

Data
- (Anonymized) parcel volume data with size (width, height, length), weight, destination (country, ZIP), and parcel product (SLA) over time. If possible, we will add anonymized shipping parties.
- Timestamps for previously announced parcels and the time they physically arrived at a facility (Site ID and Site ZIP). 
- Sorting Results at the moment parcels arrive at a physical facility (chute and working shift).

Tech stack
