# CIEM6302 Advanced Data Science for Traffic and Transportation Engineering PrimeVision Group 1
Welcome to our README. 
We implemented four models to forecast the volume for every chute for every sorting center. 
The final code and results can be found in notebook_main.ipynb. Here we first prepare the data, followed by evaluating the model and finally create a dashboard where the company is able to make forecast with three different models.
The backlog of our project can be found in the Wiki
