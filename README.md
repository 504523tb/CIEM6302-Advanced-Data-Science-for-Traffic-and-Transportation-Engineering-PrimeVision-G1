Main Question: \
How can time-series forecasting methods be used to predict future parcel volume in warehouses?

Subquestions:
1. Which time-series forecasting methods can accurately predict the parcel volume?
2. Which features significantly contribute to the prediction accuracy?
3. What parameter has high predictability to determine the amount of packages?
- Volume
- Day of the week
- Seasonality
4. What parameter has high predictability to determine the volume of packages?
- Volume
- Day of the week
- Seasonality
5. Can external factors such as holidays, weather, economic conditions improve prediction accuracy?
6. What metrics should be used to evaluate the accuracy of the time-series models?
7. How can the predictions be validated to ensure they are reliable for real-world application?
8. How can we optimally integrate our machine learning model into AWS to improve user ease and accessibility?

Data
- (Anonymized) parcel volume data with size (width, height, length), weight, destination (country, ZIP), and parcel product (SLA) over time. If possible, we will add anonymized shipping parties.
- Timestamps for previously announced parcels and the time they physically arrived at a facility (Site ID and Site ZIP). 
- Sorting Results at the moment parcels arrive at a physical facility (chute and working shift).
