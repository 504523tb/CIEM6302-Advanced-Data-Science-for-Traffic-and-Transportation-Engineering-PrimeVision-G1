Main Question
How can we utilize historical data to predict future parcel volume and characteristics like size, weight and shipper using time-series forecasting methods?

Subquestions:
1. Data Preparation and Quality
•	What types of historical data are available (e.g., parcel size, weight, shipper, date)?
•	How can we clean and preprocess historical data to ensure accurate predictions?
•	How do we handle missing or incomplete data in the historical dataset?
•	What is the frequency of the historical data (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), and how does it affect forecasting?
•	What time period should the historical data cover to make reliable predictions?
2. Feature Selection and Engineering
•	What are the most important features from the historical data that influence parcel volume and characteristics?
•	Can external factors (e.g., holidays, weather, economic conditions) improve prediction accuracy?
•	How can we encode categorical variables like shippers for use in forecasting models?
3. Time-Series Forecasting Models
•	What time-series forecasting methods (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) are most suitable for predicting parcel volume and characteristics?
•	How do we determine the best model for forecasting based on the data characteristics?
•	How should seasonality, trends, and cyclic patterns be incorporated into the time-series models?
•	Can ensemble methods (combining multiple models) improve the accuracy of the predictions?
4. Predicting Specific Parcel Characteristics
•	How can time-series forecasting be applied specifically to predict the size and weight of parcels?
•	What is the relationship between parcel volume and shipper behavior, and how can it be modeled?
•	How can we predict the proportion of different shippers contributing to future parcel volumes?
5. Model Evaluation and Validation
•	What metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE, MAPE) should be used to evaluate the accuracy of the time-series models?
•	How do we validate the predictions to ensure they are reliable for real-world application?
•	How can we test the robustness of the model against unexpected fluctuations or anomalies in the data?
6. Scalability and Implementation
•	How can the forecasting model be integrated into the current logistics system for operational use?
•	How frequently should the model be retrained or updated with new data to maintain accuracy?
•	What computational resources are required to run the forecasting model at scale?
7. Business and Operational Impact
•	How can these predictions help optimize logistics operations (e.g., staffing, resource allocation)?
•	What are the potential cost savings or revenue increases from accurately forecasting parcel volumes and characteristics?
•	How can this forecasting be leveraged to improve customer experience (e.g., delivery time, packaging needs)?
