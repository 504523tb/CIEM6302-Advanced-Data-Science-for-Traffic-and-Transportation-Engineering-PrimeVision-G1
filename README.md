Welcome to our README. 

We implemented four models to forecast the volume for each chute at every sorting center. Two of these models, linear regression and a neural network, employ standard machine learning techniques. The other two models, ARIMA and LSTM/GRU, utilize time-series forecasting approaches.

The final code and results can be found in notebook_main.ipynb. Here we first prepare the data, followed by evaluating the model and finally create a dashboard where the company is able to make forecast with three different models.

The backlog of our project can be found in the Wiki
